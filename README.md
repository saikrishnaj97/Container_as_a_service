# Container_as_a_service
Container-based virtualization is a disruptive technology that is being adopted at a remarkable
pace by small and medium size businesses. Enterprises show great interest as well but they are
approaching the adoption in production environment very carefully. Google Search, Google App
Engine, and Twitter are successful examples of using containers on a grand scale.
In the project I have tried to show the advantage of using container over virtualization .
Containers provide a lower downtime and faster scaling abilities then conventional virtual
machines. As we saw migration of containers from over all under utilized host is always a better
option since containers are more portable than vmâ€™s and can be directly used in production level
environment. Containers management tools like Docker help us work with containers in both
development and production. It would be safe to say containerisation is the future of application
portability.
